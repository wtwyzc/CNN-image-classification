# CNN-image-classification
- Based on my research assignment and the key code created for the dataset, this repository is not complete due to data privacy and upload file size limitations.
  
## capability
- Based on ResNet-18
- through transfer learning
- the crawled images are classified according to how much text they contain
- and the longer text in the images is extracted (by invoking the ocr API).
